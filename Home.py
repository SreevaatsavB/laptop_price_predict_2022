    There are many limitations for a project like this, the major one is the amount of data available which affects the flexiblity of the several models.
    Especially the deep learning models need humungous amounts of data, which is not a possible for this particular problem, as 
    the amount of laptops in productions would generally not be in such gigantic amounts.
